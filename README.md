**Name**: Photos from the Great Beyond, front-end

**Description**: Our project serves as the front-end to a full-stack app that allows users to view a collection of photos originally hosted on NASA's API. Users can access some of NASA's "Photo of the Day" entries, as well as photos taken from NASA's Mars Rovers. In addition to this functionality, our app features an Amateur Astronomers gallery where users can upload their own images and view photos that have already been uploaded.

**Technologies**: This front-end was built mostly using React. The project also makes use of Styled Components, the React Router, and plain CSS.

**Project Status**: This project was a group project created by students at a Software Engineering boot camp. This project may be revisited in the future to fix current bugs or implement new features.

**Roadmap**: Possible fixes/additions for the future include fixing issue with text/photos spilling out of their containers when single images are being viewed, adding a signup/login feature, improving performance of the page


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
